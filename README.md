# Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection
We adopted the [Ultra Fast Lane Detection](https://github.com/cfzd/Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection) project for the autonomous model vehicle of our university. 

## Project overview
The source code of this project is based on the original project (see link above). The reworked project is splitted into two parts
- Train: Train a model;  only small adjustments to the code
- Runtime: Used for everything besides training, eg testing or "real world use"; extensive new development of the code

The scripts directory contains many scripts "around" the project, eg to convert/prepare Datasets or to record testing data from [CARLA](https://carla.org/).
